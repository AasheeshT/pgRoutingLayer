## Layer Naming Convention

When using the "Export" or "Export Merge" Buttons a new layer is created with the following structure:

```
(< M >< U|D >) < function >: < parameter > BBOX(< bbox >)
```

Where:

- M = when Export Merged button is used
- < U|D >:
  - U = Undirected
  - D = Directed
- < bbox > = xMin yMin, xMax yMax
